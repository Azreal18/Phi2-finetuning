# Model Card for Phi-2 Finetuned Model

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->
This model is a finetuned version of Microsoft's Phi-2, optimized for specific downstream tasks using the PEFT library.

## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->
The Phi-2 Finetuned Model is designed to enhance the performance of the base Phi-2 model on targeted tasks. It leverages the PEFT library for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases, and limitations of the model. Regular audits and updates are recommended to mitigate these issues.

## How to Get Started with the Model

Use the code below to get started with the model.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/phi-2-finetuned")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/phi-2-finetuned")

input_text = "Your input text here"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
